# Overview

EZRX is a plug-in for Rhino that helps a user use Chat GPT to create scripted Grasshopper nodes. We built this for the AEC Tech 2023 Hackathon in New York hosted by CORE studio and Thornton Thomasetti.

# Background and Motivation

Architects don't have time or motivation to learn to code, but would benefit from using scripts for creating reproducible workflows and more complex forms. 

Today an architect can use Chat GPT to request code, but someone without programming experience can find it hard to get Chat GPT to produce working code. 
They need to provide sufficient context with the prompt to get a working result. 

# What we did 

[Todo]

# Libraries used

* Rhino API
* Roslyn SDK
* Ara3D Library - utility functions
* OpenAI 
* 

# What we learned 

* Don't post API keys to Github
* Chat GPT 4 is much more powerful than GPT 3.5 
* Don't ask too much from your prompt or it can get confused 
* Getting working code requires providing a lot of additional context  

# Next Steps 

[Todo]

# Cloning the Repository 

This module used the `github.com\ara3d\ara3d` project as a submodule.

From the command-line you can pull the submodules using:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
